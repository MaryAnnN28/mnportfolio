            Hello! Iâ€™m Mary Ann Navarrete, a full-stack software engineer based in the Washington, DC area. I enjoy building things that provide solutions and efficiency, while creating insightful, dynamic user experiences with a pop of style. 
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
            My background comes from 15 years of sales and marketing leadership in the hospitality and travel industry. Some of my expertise are working with Government clients, e-commerce marketing, and adding creative touches to any work I do. 
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
            Part problem-solver that loves data-driven analysis, part design maven with an eye for styling, I get to enjoy the best of both worlds tapping into both my passions as a full stack developer. 
            </p>
